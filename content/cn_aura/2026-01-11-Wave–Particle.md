个人表现在他人眼中是粒子性强还是波动性强是有客观判断的。

粒子性强：从一而终。就像一次Markov chain simulation.
波动性强：他好像这个也会那个也会。探测：他最近在干嘛，怎么样。结果fromA：做维修 fromB:做游戏

两者皆为真，但事实上它们发生在不同的时间维度。如同一位巫师，对于同一问题的不同运作机制，真相会因人而分别成立。这个问题本质上是"搜寻行为"——它实际上是在一个人的记忆疆域中进行探索。

我们假设世界知晓万物。只要你提出恰当的问题，答案总在那里。

因此，当答案出现分歧时，你需要确保自己的提问具有更严谨的范式，将问题的"可能空间"收敛至唯一解；或是退后一步，以更广阔的视角审视你所关注变量的分布规律。

在时空架构的框架内，事物的真伪可以成立。这种真伪判断如同开关般每一秒都在跳动或发生。世界就像无数开关与节点紧密相连的网络。而开关本身是时间显现之前就存在的本体。但空间必须先行存在。 于是数学便在此时登场：当假设成立时，关于空间运作规律与行为模式是什么样的。

They are both true, but each one is happening at a different time, actually. It is wizard that,truth is established differently for different people for different mechanisms of the same problem. The same problem is a "search action "that actually searches in the land of one's memory.

Now, the world knows everything. If you can ask appropriately, the answer is always there.

So， when the answer is different, you want to make sure that your question has a more strict formula that narrows down the "possible space" of your problem to only one case, or you take a step back to see a broader view and the distribution of the variable you care about.

Things can be true in the framework of time-space architecture. And the true-false is ticking or happening every second like a switch. The world is largely connected like tons of switches and nodes. *And the switch itself is a former existence before time even shows up. But the space must show itself at the very beginning.* So it is the time that math takes place: The math about how space works and behaves when there is a hypothesis.
